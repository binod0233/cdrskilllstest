              Career Episodes are the most critical aspect of CDR report
              authoring. Making a good impression on Engineers Australia takes
              additional thought and effort. There are three career episodes in
              CDR, and each episode is based on three separate projects that you
              completed in your last year of engineering, internship program,
              and working projects. Our experienced team can support you in
              preparing Career Episode Writing based on your professional
              experiences by enabling you to write all three career episodes
              distinctively.
