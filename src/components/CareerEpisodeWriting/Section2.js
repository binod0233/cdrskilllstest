          data="Writing a Career Episode Report is both an art and a science. While EA assesses your engineering ability through career episodes, 
it warns you not to incorporate too many technicalities. As a result, deciding how much technicality to provide is an art.
The Career 
Episode Report is all about YOU! Engineers Australia expects to read what YOU did rather than what the TEAM did. As a result, make 
sure that your input is printed correctly.
Each Career Episode report focuses on one Competency Unit and the factors that follow it. 
The competency units fluctuate depending on the occupational category you are applying for.
